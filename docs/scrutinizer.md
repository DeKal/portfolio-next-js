## Scrutinizer
While circle CI provide many strong CI features, Scrutinizer is extremely good at checking for code assurance and code coverage. In this project, Scrutinizer has these roles:
1) Detect bugs and issues from the new Pull Request(PR), this called Code Assurance or Code Quality.
2) Keeping track of code coverage status.
3) Do weekly report and suggest for better Code quality.
