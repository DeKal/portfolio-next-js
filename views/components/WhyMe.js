          <blockquote>
            <p>
              A wide range of experiences in web framework backing up by 5 years
              of pursuing the competitive programming, I have the confidence
              that I can adapt to any languages, frameworks, or complicated
              system in a short period of time. I am a fast-learner and can be
              in charge the role of team leader when push comes to shove. On the
              other hand, I can communicate effectively in English as my
              secondary language, so the barrier of language is no longer a big
              threat. I am dedicated and will strive to make a profit for the
              team.
